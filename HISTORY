 * [pending] version should be controlled by cmake instead of a static entry in:
  - src/ someheaderfile or define
  - doc/ doxygen definition file
 * [pending] doxygen support is there and optional


 * wrote 'make install' step using cmake 
 * WARNING: src/win32/ is not used at all, maybe someone has to test this with win32 ...
 * changed the library #include "noise.h" instead of "noise/noise.h"
   there is no /include directory anymore since one must use src/ as include path now
   which will the be searched for "noise.h" now
 * cmake: created a CMakeList.txt which builds the .so and .a file
 * removed static Makefiles and libtool
